title: "Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Western Dairy Industry"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/covid_2021
excerpt: 'Western dairy accounts for 46% of U.S. milk production and was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in complex ways. The pandemic led to large fluctuations in U.S. prices of milk and dairy products. High prices during the summer made up for steep declines in the spring. Western milk production was up over 2019. Farm milk receipts were about the same as in 2019, and about 12% higher than in 2018. However, due to large government payments, 2020 was a relatively high net income year for the Western dairy industry, despite the variability and stresses caused by the pandemic.'
