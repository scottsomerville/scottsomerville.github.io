excerpt: 'Navel Orangeworm (NOW) infestations damage tree nuts, reduce grower revenue, require costly management practices to control, and threaten food safety and trade. We estimate that from 2018 through 2021, almond and pistachio growers spent an average of $393 and $262 per bearing acre, respectively, on winter sanitation and pesticide sprays targeting NOW. These costs are equivalent to 7.8% of almond and 3.7% of pistachio revenues.'

Navel Orangeworm (NOW) is the top pest of California almonds and pistachios and affects other crops like walnuts, pomegranates, and figs. Female NOW moths lay their eggs on the fruiting bodies of tree nuts, and the resulting larvae burrow through the shell and eat the kernel. NOW damage is linked to aflatoxin contamination (a carcinogen) threatening food safety and exports to highly regulated key markets, such as the European Union. 

This article provides an analysis of NOW management practices and associated costs and benefits in almond and pistachio orchards. Our study focuses on years 2018 through 2021, including the most recent available pesticide use and cost data, and where appropriate, averages over four years to avoid bias caused by alternate bearing crop yields.
