permalink: /publication/drought_and_prices_2021
excerpt: 'Droughts in California reduce the availability of irrigation water, raise costs, and have dire consequences for some farms. However, as with earlier droughts, the 2020–2021 drought is having only small impacts on farm revenues and prices. Farm responses to drought generally minimize the drought’s overall impacts and protect consumers from severe food price increases.'

Droughts in California reduce the availability of irrigation water, raise costs, and have dire consequences for some farms. However, as with earlier droughts, the 2020–2021 drought is having only small impacts on farm revenues and prices. Farm responses to drought generally minimize the drought’s overall impacts and protect consumers from severe food price increases.
