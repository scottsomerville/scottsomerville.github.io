## Navel Orangeworm Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Economic Calculator for Almond Production

This Navel Orangeworm (NOW) integrated pest management (IPM) cost and benefit calculator allows users to explore how changing from their Current IPM program to a New IPM program may impact profitability in almond production.

Navel Orangeworm (NOW) is the top pest in California Almonds. Infestations damage nuts, are costly to manage, and affect the price per pound of edible nuts growers receive. This NOW integrated pest management (IPM) cost and benefit calculator explores how different IPM programs may impact grower profits.

Mating disruption is an increasingly popular Navel Orangeworm (NOW) control practice. However, weighing the costs and benefits of new technologies is burdensome, especially when growersâ€™ attention is needed in other priority areas of their business. The calculator requires a handful of numerical inputs, is prepopulated with representative values, and calculates the net revenue from two IPM programs to allow users to quickly and conveniently weigh IPM approaches.
