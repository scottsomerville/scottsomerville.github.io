# The Impact of Land Use on Water Quality: Evidence from California Wells
### Co-authored with Pierre Mérel and Jeffrey Hadachek.

### Abstract

Nitrate pollution threatens human health and ecosystems in many regions of the world. Although scientists agree that nitrogen compounds from human activity, notably agriculture, enter the groundwater system, empirical estimates of the impacts of land use on nitrate concentrations in well water are still lacking. We provide evidence of such impacts by combining nitrate concentration measurements from about 6,000 groundwater wells with a data set of remotely sensed land uses for California over the period 2007--2023. Results show that a 10 percentage point increase in the share of land used to grow high-nitrogen crops within 500 meters of a well relative to undeveloped land is associated with a 12\% increase in nitrate concentrations, while a 10 percentage point increase in the share of land used for low-intensity urban development is associated with a 10\% increase. Local dairy cattle populations also meaningfully contribute to nitrate pollution. However, conditioning on initial nitrate measurements, we find limited evidence that human activity affects nitrate concentrations a decade later.

# Spatially Targeted and Differentiated Pesticide Policy: The Case of the Groundwater Protection Program
### Co-authored with Brittney Goodrich

### Abstract

When market-based instruments are impractical for addressing agricultural non-point source pollution, economists recommend regulations that incorporate farm management practices and environmental services to mitigate pollution. In this paper, we examine the adjustments farmers make to their pesticide programs in response to a policy delineating two types of regulated regions that differ in the required practices for pesticide usage based on local environmental conditions. Empirically, this study addresses the Groundwater Protection Program, which created a natural experiment through abrupt and uneven changes in the regulations governing the application of seven pesticides. Utilizing twenty-five years of field-level data, we estimate the program's impacts on the use of regulated active ingredients and the consequent environmental effects in the perennial crops almonds, citrus, and grapes using a difference-in-differences regression framework. Our analysis reveals that the program led to meaningful reductions in the use of regulated active ingredients in fields in regulated regions. However, the extent to which almond, citrus, and grape growers responded to the program varied substantially across crops. Additionally, we find evidence that the program induced almond growers to alter the mix and quantity of active ingredients used in orchards, resulting in no change in an aggregate measure of environmental impact that considers the potential harm of pesticides to water systems, human health, and wildlife. On the other hand, we find evidence that the environmental impact of regulated and alternative ingredients decreased in citrus groves and grape vineyards relative to control fields.

# Does Mating Disruption Decrease Insecticide Use? Evidence from Navel Orangeworm Management in California Tree Nut Orchards
### Co-authored with Brittney Goodrich.

### Excerpt

Navel Orangeworm (NOW) is the top pest in California almonds. Infestations damage nuts, reduce grower revenue, require costly management practices to control, and threaten food safety and exports because of its link to aflatoxin contamination (Campbell, Molyneux, and Schatzki 2003; Palumbo et al. 2014). Growers typically manage NOW with insecticide sprays and cultural controls, but uncertainty in the future pesticide regulatory landscape threatens to restrict the chemical tools growers can use. 
In recent years, NOW mating disruption has emerged as a promising new pest management technology in tree nut production. Mating disruption uses pheromones to confuse adult NOW moths, interrupt mating patterns, and reduce the number of larvae that can go on to damage nuts. Results from recent experiments in Central Valley almond orchards show about a 50% reduction in nut damage when mating disruption is used in combination with synthetic insecticides compared to insecticides only (Higbee and Bucks 2021; Haviland et al. 2021). However, extension specialists and others recommend that growers use mating disruption in combination with synthetic insecticides and cultural controls (Haviland et al. 2023; Coatney 2019). 
	In this paper, we answer the following questions. (1) To what extent do almond growers change the number of chemical pesticide applications targeting Navel Orangeworm in response to the use of mating disruption? (2) To what extent do almond growers change the grams per acre of active ingredients targeting Navel Orangeworm in response to the use of mating disruption?
California tree nut growers face several production challenges going forward, including uncertainty in the pesticide regulatory landscape, labor and fuel costs, and the effects of climate change (Osteen and Fernandez‐Cornejo 2013; Pathak et al. 2018). Growers rely on innovations to address economic challenges, particularly costly pest pressures and state and federal regulations. 
This paper leverages pesticide-use data from the California Department of Pesticide Regulations, the most comprehensive dataset of pesticide-use in the world. In our econometric estimation, we use the spatial first difference method proposed by Druckenmiller and Hsiang (2019) in order to leverage variation in pesticide use between neighboring orchards.

# Economics of By-Product Feeds in Dairy Rations, With Implications for Resource Use and Environmental Consequences
### Co-authored with Jarrett Hart and Daniel A. Sumner.

### Abstract 

Spent grains and grape pomace are by-products of beer and wine production that, where economically feasible, are commonly used as animal feed. In California, they are most commonly used by local dairy farms, replacing feeds that require additional resources such as land and irrigation water. We quantify the substantial resource consequences of repurposing these by-products for use as feed for dairy cattle by estimating the land and water needed for replacement feeds. We also estimate the considerable environmental implications, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, when these by-products are diverted to landfills.
