# "Land Use and Nitrate Concentrations in Groundwater: Evidence from Groundwater Wells in California." Co-authored with Jeffrey Hadachek.

### Abstract

Nitrate pollution of groundwater is a pernicious issue affecting people and ecosystems in many regions of the world. Although scientists agree that nitrogen compounds from human activity enter the groundwater system, there remains a need for estimates of the causal impacts of land use on the nitrate concentrations in well water––the location where nitrate contamination has the largest impact on human health. In this paper, we provide evidence of the link between nitrate concentrations measured in well water and local land use using a dataset of repeated cross-sectional samples of about 5,000 groundwater wells and a detailed dataset of remotely sensed land uses from 2007 to 2021. Findings show that a 10 percentage point increase in the share of land use to grow high nitrogen crops within 500 meters of a well (for example, from 5% to 15% of the land surrounding a well) relative to undeveloped land leads to a 5.8% increase in nitrate concentrations within 5 to 12 years. Compare this to a 10 percentage point increase in land developed for urban use, which leads to a 1.6% increase in nitrate concentrations over a similar time frame.


# “Economics of By-Product Feeds in Dairy Rations, With Implications for Resource Use and Environmental Consequences.” Co-authored with Jarrett Hart and Daniel A. Sumner.

### Abstract 

Spent grains and grape pomace are by-products of beer and wine production that, where economically feasible, are commonly used as animal feed. In California, they are most commonly used by local dairy farms, replacing feeds that require additional resources such as land and irrigation water. We quantify the substantial resource consequences of repurposing these by-products for use as feed for dairy cattle by estimating the land and water needed for replacement feeds. We also estimate the considerable environmental implications, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, when these by-products are diverted to landfills.

# “Does Mating Disruption Decrease Insecticide Use? Evidence from Navel Orangeworm Management in California Tree Nut Orchards.” Co-authored with Brittney Goodrich.

### Excerpt

Navel Orangeworm (NOW) is the top pest in California almonds. Infestations damage nuts, reduce grower revenue, require costly management practices to control, and threaten food safety and exports because of its link to aflatoxin contamination (Campbell, Molyneux, and Schatzki 2003; Palumbo et al. 2014). Growers typically manage NOW with insecticide sprays and cultural controls, but uncertainty in the future pesticide regulatory landscape threatens to restrict the chemical tools growers can use. 
In recent years, NOW mating disruption has emerged as a promising new pest management technology in tree nut production. Mating disruption uses pheromones to confuse adult NOW moths, interrupt mating patterns, and reduce the number of larvae that can go on to damage nuts. Results from recent experiments in Central Valley almond orchards show about a 50% reduction in nut damage when mating disruption is used in combination with synthetic insecticides compared to insecticides only (Higbee and Bucks 2021; Haviland et al. 2021). However, extension specialists and others recommend that growers use mating disruption in combination with synthetic insecticides and cultural controls (Haviland et al. 2023; Coatney 2019). 
	In this paper, we answer the following questions. (1) To what extent do almond growers change the number of chemical pesticide applications targeting Navel Orangeworm in response to the use of mating disruption? (2) To what extent do almond growers change the grams per acre of active ingredients targeting Navel Orangeworm in response to the use of mating disruption?
California tree nut growers face several production challenges going forward, including uncertainty in the pesticide regulatory landscape, labor and fuel costs, and the effects of climate change (Osteen and Fernandez‐Cornejo 2013; Pathak et al. 2018). Growers rely on innovations to address economic challenges, particularly costly pest pressures and state and federal regulations. 
This paper leverages pesticide-use data from the California Department of Pesticide Regulations, the most comprehensive dataset of pesticide-use in the world. In our econometric estimation, we use the spatial first difference method proposed by Druckenmiller and Hsiang (2019) in order to leverage variation in pesticide use between neighboring orchards.
